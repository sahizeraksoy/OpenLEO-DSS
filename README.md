OpenLEO-DSS:
Open-Source Explainable AI and Multi-Source Data Fusion for Out-of-Distribution Collision Prediction in LEO

Overview:
OpenLEO-DSS is an open-source decision support system designed to enhance orbital safety and Space Situational Awareness (SSA). 
The platform focuses on mitigating positional uncertainty in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) through explainable AI (XAI) and multi-source data integration.

Academic Context:
OpenLEO-DSS is an independent research initiative conceived and developed by Şahizer Aksoy. 
The project is being carried out during postgraduate studies at Karamanoğlu Mehmetbey University (KMU), Türkiye, and aims to provide transparent, zero-cost tools for satellite operators in support of global space sustainability.
